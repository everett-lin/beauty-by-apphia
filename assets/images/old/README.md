### Summary
My girlfriend entered the beauty industry in 2016 (high school) when she first began a small business doing prom hair/makeup for friends. Over the last 7 years, she has scaled her small business to do weddings, hair styling, special occasions with over 50+ clients per year.  As her business has grown she realized that she needed to create a professional website so that more clients could find her. The purpose of this hair and makeup artist website is to serve as an online platform for her to display her skills, promote her services, and attract new clients in the Seattle area.
